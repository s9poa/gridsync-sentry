## What is GridSync Sentry
GridSync Sentry is a web application that tracks real-time video game deals from digital storefronts. Built with **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, and the **CheapShark API**, it emphasizes a clean, responsive interface designed for fast browsing and distraction-free deal discovery.

## Built With
- TypeScript  
- SCSS  
- CheapShark REST API  

## Purpose
The goal of GridSync Sentry was to create a practical tool for exploring live game deals while sharpening my front-end and API integration skills. I wanted the experience to feel streamlined and simple, with curated categories and smooth navigation that make finding relevant deals effortless.

## What I Learned
This project gave me hands-on experience working with **REST APIs**, managing cached data for performance, and building custom UI components from scratch with **SCSS**. It also strengthened my understanding of creating accessible, responsive designs and handling real-world challenges like pagination, rate limits, and session storage.

## Key Features
- Integrates the CheapShark REST API to display live video game pricing  
- Features pagination, session caching, and dynamic redirect modals  
- Curates categories with custom sorting and price-based logic  
- Designed with custom SCSS components for a consistent UI system  
- Optimized for usability and performance without prebuilt UI kits
